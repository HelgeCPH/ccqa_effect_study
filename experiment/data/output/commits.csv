There is a bug in actions/checkout v1.0.0 that prevents re-running a
github workflow, which is needed in some cases when there is a random
failure (e.g. network failure downloaded dependencies). This updates it
to v2.0.0, which fixes this issue. Also updates SonarCloud to use a
specific version instead of master. We've had issues in the past where
the master branch was undergoing development and broke our builds.
Sticking to a specific version prevents that.

The SonarCloud action is currently configured to always run on any push,
regardless of the repo that the branch was pushed to, including the main
repo or any GitHub forks. And that action is configured to always use
the Apache Daffodil SonarCloud project, which requires a SONAR_TOKEN
secret that forks will not have. This means that any pushes to a fork
will result in a failure of the SonarCloud action, which might be
confusing to new users.

This adds a condition to the SonarCloud job so that it is only run when
the repository it was triggered from is the main Daffodil repository.
This repo will always have the correct SONAR_TOKEN so that the action
can succeed.

Sonarcloud requires that the src/main directory exists for its scans,
even if there are no sources. Commit 064d7b8655 removed all the .keep
files which caused the src/main directory in daffodil-test and
daffodil-test-ibm1 to be deleted since those modules have no actual
sources. But this caused Sonarcloud failures.

To fix this, add back the .keep files for only these two directories so
that sonarcloud scan will work. It's also possible some IDE's might be
unhappy without src/main directories, so this isn't necessarily
sonarcloud specific.

Add a new runtime2 backend to Daffodil with a C code generator and
libcli/libruntime libraries.  The C code generator implements a small
but still functional subset of DFDL 1.0 for binary data:

- binary boolean, integer, and real numbers
- arrays of simple and complex elements
- choice groups using dispatch/branch keys
- validation of ""fixed"" attributes
- padding of explicit length complex elements with fill bytes

Also add a new CLI subcommand ""daffodil generate"" to call the code
generator and modify the CLI subcommand ""daffodil test"" to support
running TDML tests with daffodil-runtime2.

We are documenting reviewer requested changes in [Runtime2
ToDos](https://daffodil.apache.org/dev/design-notes/runtime2-todos/).
We plan to address these changes while continuing to build out the C
code generator to implement more of the ""Runtime 2 Design"" table in
<https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/DAFFODIL/WIP%3A+Daffodil+Runtime+2>.
Build requirements and instructions are in the top-level README.md and
BUILD.md files.

*What's for?*
OOTB the port offset is interesting in at least 3 cases:
# To simultaneously run tests on the same Buildbot machine. This is related to http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/www-builds/201209.mbox/%3C002101cd991b$0a16de50$1e449af0$@16degrees.com.au%3E
# To simultaneously run the demos without having to change much things, just one parameter
# To eventually run Sonar on OFBiz sources https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-3590

*How it's done?*
Basically, I just added a portoffset integer parameter to some ant targets (of course this JVM param can also be used in a Java call from command line):
* in trunk and R13.07: start, start-batch, start-debug, start-pos, start-both, run-tests and run-test
* in R12.04 and R11.04: run-tests, run-test. I did not set start targets because anyway it would miss the admin port offset, withouh much changes. So can't be used to demonstrate. We will continue to use the current paches for those.

The portoffset parameter is set to zero by default in ClassLoaderContainer.java. 
If a value is passed, it's then grabed by Config.java and passed to ClassLoaderContainer.java, where it's set to this value.

 The portoffset is then used to change in one shoot all the default ports values defined (in config or hardcoded), and the admin port value in R13.07 and trunk.
This is done in following classes:
CatalinaContainer
NamingServiceContainer
ServiceEngine through ServiceLocation
RmiServiceContainer
XMLRPCClientEngine
XmlRpcTests

To avoid hardcoding locations in services definitions, I also had to create some service-locations: main-local-soap and main-remote-soap 

*What are the constraints?*
* For demos: the offset should not be applied to trunk because <service-location name=""main-remote-soap"" location=""http://demo-trunk.ofbiz.apache.org:8080/webtools/control/SOAPService""/> is used for tests by trunk *and all releases*. It's useless to apply to trunk anyway,  offsetting port in releases is enough.
* I did not take into account the Ideal payment harcoded port values in IdealPaymentServiceTest.java. Weirdly I did not cross error during tests, though it seems there are tests using an harcoded port in url.

*What is the status?*
Locally (on Win XP)  I ran many tests combinations with <<ant load-demo run-tests>>.  
Applying the portoffset on a sole running test instance has no effects. I have still some fails (no errors) but those are not related to my changes, they appear also without.
But when I run a combination of any releases/trunk but with R11.04, I get a time out error with testSOAPSimpleService, that I can't explain so far. 
If I run the trunk alone with the portoffset no errors occur. Same if I run a release with portoffset and only testSOAPSimpleService in trunk (w/ or w/o portoffset)

*To summarize:* these changes will be used to run Buildot tests instances simultaneously . And, for coming releases, to run demos without having to create patches. Simply running ant start with a portoffset value which will take care of all ports values, including admin port. For running R12.04 demo as stable we will still need to create a patch for the last time.

*What I will to do for now:* commit the patches and test if I cross the same issue on Buildbot. If it's the same (99% chances it will) I will revert and will continue to locally try to find the reason . I believe this issue is unrelated to the changes I implemened.  And it's just because it's now possible to simultaneously run tests that it appears. 

BTW I just noticed that when you run R11.04 with R12.04, R12.04 takes almost all the CPU (XP is not very, while when running any combinations w/o R11.04 the CPU load is shared. 
Also there are far less tests in R11.04, which coul be the reason when I run it with another test run instance there are no issues.  Because R11.04 tests finish before the other instance gets to run testSOAPSimpleService.

*What's for?*
Finally, OOTB the port offset is interesting in 2 cases:
# To eventually run Sonar on OFBiz sources https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-3590
# To simultaneously run the demos without having to change much things, just one parameter (this will need to have the same commited in R13.07... to be discussed...)

Of course, It can be used for other purposes outside of the ASF context...

*How it's done?*
Basically, I just added a portoffset integer parameter to 3 ant targets (of course this JVM param can also be used in a Java call from command line): start, start-pos, start-both,

The portoffset parameter is set to zero by default in ClassLoaderContainer.java. 
If a value is passed, it's then grabed by Config.java and passed to ClassLoaderContainer.java, where it's set to this value.

 The portoffset is then used to change in one shoot all the default ports values defined (in config or hardcoded), and the admin port value
This is done in following classes:
CatalinaContainer
NamingServiceContainer
ServiceEngine through ServiceLocation
RmiServiceContainer
XMLRPCClientEngine
XmlRpcTests

To avoid hardcoding locations in services definitions, I also created 2 service-locations: main-http and main-soap

*To summarize:* these changes will be used to run ""ant start"" with a portoffset value which will take care of all ports values, including admin port. For running R12.04 demo as stable we will still need to create a patch for the last time. R13.07 could have a similar patch applied since it's not yet released...

This was waiting for a moment in my working copy after I found that there was an issue with testSOAPSimpleService when portoffset was used with run-tests target.
I have still no resolved this issue, but since I got a better way to run simultaneous Buildbot instances this is no longer an issue for run-tests target.
So I commit these small pending changes in order to allow to run Sonar on OFBiz https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-3590.
The cobertura target does not work yet but what's committed here is needed anyway to progress with INFRA-3590.

After getting consensus from the community in the email thread below
we agreed to remove these two items because they make the startup
logic more complex and also because many things are broken and 
unmaintained for years.

It is a good idea to reintroduce cobertura in the future on a cleaner
implementation, hopefully completely away from the start component and
perhaps as a container implementation.

Creating a new Random object each time a random value is needed is inefficient and may produce numbers which are not random depending on the JDK. For better efficiency and randomness, create a single Random, then store, and reuse it.

The Random() constructor tries to set the seed with a distinct value every time. However there is no guarantee that the seed will be random or even uniformly distributed. Some JDK will use the current time as seed, which makes the generated numbers not random at all.

This rule finds cases where a new Random is created each time a method is invoked and assigned to a local random variable."

Though the above code is quite safe from any SQL injection as the passed values are not related to any user input.

SQL queries often need to use a hardcoded SQL string with a dynamic parameter coming from a user request. Formatting a string to add those parameters to the request is a bad practice as it can result in an SQL injection. The safe way to add parameters to a SQL query is to use SQL binding mechanisms.

We should use parameterized queries, prepared statements, or stored procedures whenever possible."

When a method is designed to return an invariant value, it may be poor design, but it shouldn't adversely affect the outcome of your program. However, when it happens on all paths through the logic, it is surely a bug."

Connections, streams, files, and other classes that implement the Closeable interface or its super-interface, AutoCloseable, needs to be closed after use. Further, that close call must be made in a finally block otherwise an exception could keep the call from being made. Preferably, when class implements AutoCloseable, resource should be created using try-with-resources pattern and will be closed automatically."
